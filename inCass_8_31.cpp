#include <iostream> //gives access to files I did not write 

using namespace std; //adds something like a more clarifying namespace. Standard template library. COntroversial because it says reference everything in the std library. Covers the whole library and may be using unnecessary things

int main(void){
    
    cout << "Hello Clemson!" << endl; //output arrows. also could've  << '\n'; instead of endl
}
